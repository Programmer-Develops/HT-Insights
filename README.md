Smart Health Tracker Insights

This project explores data collected from wearable fitness devices to uncover meaningful health patterns and deliver personalized wellness recommendations. The dataset comprises 30,000 entries with features including age, gender, daily steps, heart rates, hours of sleep, calorie intake, stress levels, sleep quality, activity types, and mood. Through this data, we aim to apply regression to predict sleep and calorie metrics, classification to understand mood and stress, clustering to identify user behavior patterns, and time series analysis to observe trends over time. The project combines statistical analysis and machine learning to enable data-informed health interventions.
